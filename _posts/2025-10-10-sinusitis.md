Sinusitis is one of the **most common ENT problems** seen in Hyderabad â€” yet often ignored until it becomes chronic.  
In simple terms, **sinusitis means inflammation of the air-filled cavities (sinuses)** around the nose and eyes.  
These sinuses normally produce mucus that drains through small openings into the nose. When blocked, infection develops.

## Types of Sinusitis

- **Acute Sinusitis:**  
  Short-term infection (usually after a cold or flu) lasting less than 4 weeks. Symptoms include **blocked nose, headache, facial pain, and nasal discharge**.

- **Chronic Sinusitis:**  
  Long-standing infection or inflammation lasting **more than 12 weeks**, often due to allergies, nasal polyps, or deviated septum.

## A story from my practice

A 35-year-old teacher came to my practice complaining of **persistent nasal blockage, heaviness in the head, and postnasal drip** for several months.  
She had been using nasal drops frequently for temporary relief.  
A nasal endoscopy and CT scan showed **chronic sinusitis with deviated nasal septum**.  

After a short course of medical therapy, she underwent a **Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS)** â€” a modern, scarless technique to open blocked sinuses.  
Within weeks, her symptoms resolved completely, and she could breathe freely again.

## Medical Treatment

For most patients, sinusitis can be managed without surgery.  
Treatment includes:
- **Steam inhalation and saline nasal washes** to clear mucus  
- **Antibiotics** for bacterial infection  
- **Nasal steroid sprays** to reduce swelling  
- **Antihistamines** if allergy is the cause  
- **Avoiding self-use of decongestant drops** (can cause rebound blockage)

## Surgical Treatment Options

When medical therapy fails, or if there are structural problems, surgery may be needed.  

### ðŸ”¹ Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS)
- Performed using a nasal endoscope without external cuts.  
- Opens blocked sinus openings, clears infection, and improves drainage.  
- Day-care procedure; recovery within a few days.  

### ðŸ”¹ Septoplasty
- Corrects a **deviated nasal septum** that contributes to blockage.  
- Often combined with FESS for long-term relief.

ðŸ’° **Fees:** Surgical cost depends on hospital setup and extent of surgery.  
Typically ranges between **â‚¹25,000 â€“ â‚¹60,000**, including anesthesia and follow-up.

## Complications of Chronic Sinusitis

If untreated, chronic sinusitis can cause:
- **Persistent headaches and facial pain**
- **Loss of smell**
- **Recurrent throat and ear infections**
- **Orbital or eye infection (rare)**
- **Spread of infection to brain (extremely rare but serious)**

## The Earâ€“Noseâ€“Throat Connection Explained

The **ear, nose, and throat are all connected** through air passages.  
When sinus infection spreads:
- **Postnasal drip** irritates the throat, causing **cough or sore throat**.  
- **Blocked sinuses** affect ear pressure, leading to **ear fullness or hearing issues**.  
- Chronic inflammation can impact **voice, breathing, and sleep quality**.

Thatâ€™s why ENT specialists treat the entire system, not just one organ.

## Final Thoughts

Sinusitis may seem minor at first, but chronic inflammation can significantly affect your quality of life.  
With **timely diagnosis, proper medical care, and modern endoscopic surgery**, long-term relief is possible.  

Donâ€™t ignore persistent nasal blockage or facial pain â€” your sinuses might be asking for help.
