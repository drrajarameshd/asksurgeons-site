## Myths and Facts about Renal Stones

| Myth | Fact |
|------|------|
| Drinking milk causes kidney stones | ‚ùå **False.** Calcium from milk actually binds oxalate in the intestine and prevents stone formation. |
| All stones require surgery | ‚ùå **False.** Small stones (below 5 mm) can often pass on their own with good hydration and medication. |
| Stones form suddenly | ‚ùå **False.** Stones develop gradually as minerals crystallize over weeks or months. |
| Drinking more water dissolves all stones | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partly true.** Adequate hydration prevents early crystal hardening, but large stones need medical or surgical help. |

## Symptoms of Renal Stones

- **Severe pain in the back or flank**, radiating to the lower abdomen or groin  
- **Burning sensation while urinating**  
- **Blood in urine (hematuria)**  
- **Frequent urination or urgency**  
- **Nausea, vomiting, or restlessness during pain episodes**  
- **Fever or chills** if infection is present  

If pain persists or fever develops, **consult a urologist immediately**.

## How Stones Form in Urine

Urine carries minerals like **calcium, oxalate, phosphate, and uric acid**.  
When urine becomes **concentrated** due to low fluid intake, these substances begin to **crystallize and clump together**, forming stones.

> üíß **Drinking 2.5‚Äì3 liters of water daily** keeps urine diluted and helps flush out microcrystals before they harden.

## Types of Kidney Stones (Explained Simply)

1. **Calcium Oxalate Stones (Most Common)**  
   - Form when **calcium combines with oxalate** (from foods like spinach, nuts, chocolate, tea).  
   - Focus on **reducing oxalate-rich foods** rather than avoiding calcium.  
   - Milk and curd are **safe** and beneficial in moderation.

2. **Uric Acid Stones**  
   - Seen in people with **high uric acid levels**, gout, or high-protein diets.  
   - Treated by **controlling uric acid** with medicines (like allopurinol) and **alkalizing urine** using potassium citrate.

3. **Struvite Stones**  
   - Form due to **chronic urinary infections**.  
   - Usually require antibiotics and sometimes surgery.

4. **Cystine Stones**  
   - A **genetic condition** leading to cystine crystal formation.  
   - Needs long-term monitoring and urinary alkalization.

## Medical Management

### ü©∫ Uric Acid Stones
- **Reduce uric acid** with medicines (e.g. allopurinol).  
- **Alkalinize urine** (pH above 6.5).  
- Drink plenty of fluids and limit red meat or seafood.

### üßÇ Calcium Oxalate Stones
- Limit **oxalate-rich foods** (spinach, beets, nuts, chocolate, tea).  
- Maintain **normal calcium intake** ‚Äî don‚Äôt avoid milk.  
- Reduce **salt** and **animal protein** intake.  
- Get regular **urine metabolic evaluations** for prevention.

## Surgical Treatment for Renal Stones

When stones are large, obstruct urine flow, or cause repeated infections, surgery may be necessary.

### Common Procedures
- **URS (Ureteroscopy):** A thin scope is passed into the ureter to break and remove stones.  
- **RIRS (Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery):** Laser procedure using a flexible scope to remove kidney stones.  
- **PCNL (Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy):** For large stones ‚Äî done through a small incision in the back.  

These are **minimally invasive, stitchless procedures** with quick recovery times.

## What is a DJ Stent?

A **Double J (DJ) Stent** is a **thin, soft tube** placed inside the ureter (the passage between the kidney and bladder).

### Purpose of DJ Stenting:
- Keeps the **ureter open** and allows urine to flow freely after surgery.  
- Prevents **blockage** caused by swelling or small residual fragments.  
- **Reduces postoperative pain and infection risk.**  
- Usually **removed after 1‚Äì3 weeks** through a simple outpatient procedure.

## Final Thoughts

Kidney stones are **painful but preventable**.  
Stay hydrated, eat a balanced diet, and consult your urologist early for symptoms.  
With **modern laser and endoscopic techniques**, treatment is now **safe, effective, and minimally invasive**.

Healthy kidneys start with healthy hydration.  
Drink water ‚Äî your kidneys will thank you!
