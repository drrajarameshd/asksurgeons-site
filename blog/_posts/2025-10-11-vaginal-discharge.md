## ü©∏ What Is Normal Vaginal Discharge?

Vaginal discharge is a **natural cleansing and protective fluid** produced by glands in the cervix and vagina.  
Its composition includes:

- **Good bacteria (Lactobacilli)** ‚Äî maintain an acidic pH (~3.8‚Äì4.5) to prevent harmful infections.  
- **Epithelial cells** ‚Äî shed from the vaginal lining.  
- **Mucus and water** ‚Äî secreted from cervical glands.  

A healthy discharge keeps the vagina **moist, clean, and infection-free**.

## üå∏ Hormonal Influence: Estrogen and Progesterone Phases

### 1. **Estrogen-Dominant (Pre-Ovulation Phase)**
- Occurs before ovulation, roughly **day 10‚Äì14** of the menstrual cycle.  
- **Estrogen levels rise**, increasing watery or **stretchy ‚Äúegg white‚Äù discharge**.  
- Purpose: to help sperm travel easily toward the egg.  
- Appearance: clear, slippery, elastic, and **odorless**.  
- **pH:** slightly less acidic (~4.5‚Äì5.0).

### 2. **Ovulation Phase**
- Around mid-cycle, discharge becomes **maximum and stringy**, resembling **raw egg white**.  
- Indicates high fertility.  

### 3. **Progesterone-Dominant (Post-Ovulation Phase)**
- After ovulation, **progesterone increases**.  
- Discharge becomes **thicker, creamy, or slightly yellow-white**.  
- Quantity decreases.  
- **pH returns** to more acidic range (~3.8‚Äì4.5).

## ü§∞ Physiological Changes Affecting Discharge

1. **Menstrual Cycle:**  
   - Normal variations throughout ‚Äî clear before ovulation, white after.  

2. **During Pregnancy:**  
   - Increased estrogen causes more **milky white, non-smelly discharge** (leukorrhea).  
   - Protective function ‚Äî prevents ascending infections.  

3. **Pre and Postpartum:**  
   - **Before delivery:** thick mucus plug discharge is normal.  
   - **After delivery:** reddish to yellow-white discharge (lochia) for a few weeks ‚Äî gradually lightens.
