## 🔟 Ten First Aid Tips for Fractures

### **1. Stay Calm and Reassure the Patient**
The sight of a fracture can be frightening.  
Stay composed, **reassure the injured person**, and **avoid unnecessary movement**.

---

### **2. Stop Any Bleeding**
If there’s bleeding:
- Apply gentle pressure with a **clean cloth or sterile gauze**.  
- Avoid pressing directly over a protruding bone.  
- Do **not attempt to push bone fragments inside**.

---

### **3. Immobilize the Limb**
Keep the injured limb **as still as possible**.  
Movement can worsen pain and cause further damage.  
If possible, use a **splint** — a firm support like:
- A folded magazine, stick, or cardboard.  
- Tie it gently using a bandage or cloth **above and below the fracture site**.

---

### **4. Support the Joint Above and Below**
For effective immobilization, the **joint above and below** the fracture must be supported — especially for arm and leg injuries.

---

### **5. Apply a Cold Compress**
Use an **ice pack wrapped in a towel** for 10–15 minutes.  
This helps reduce pain and swelling.  
Avoid direct ice contact on skin.

---

### **6. Keep the Limb Elevated**
If there’s swelling or bleeding, **elevate the limb** slightly above heart level using a pillow or folded cloth.  
This reduces fluid accumulation and pain.

---

### **7. Do Not Try to Straighten or Push Back**
Never attempt to **realign the bone** or **correct deformity** on your own.  
It can damage blood vessels, muscles, or nerves.

---

### **8. Check Circulation**
Check for:
- **Pulse** below the fracture  
- **Color and warmth** of fingers or toes  
If they appear **cold, blue, or numb**, seek emergency care immediately — it may indicate **vascular compromise**.

---

### **9. Avoid Giving Food or Water**
If surgery or anesthesia is required later, it’s best to **avoid feeding or giving fluids** until a doctor evaluates the patient.

---

### **10. Transport Carefully**
While taking the patient to the hospital:
- **Keep the injured limb supported** throughout.  
- For spinal or pelvic injuries, **do not move** the patient without help — call emergency services.  
- Use a **hard surface stretcher or wooden board** if possible.

---

## 🦴 When to Suspect a Fracture

- Sudden **pain, swelling, and deformity**  
- **Inability to move or bear weight**  
- **Abnormal angulation or bone protrusion**  
- **Crepitus** (grating sound on movement)

If any of these are seen, **treat as a fracture** until proven otherwise.

---

## 💡 Quick Tip

Even a small fall in elderly patients or those with osteoporosis can cause a fracture.  
Timely **first aid and immobilization** greatly improve recovery and reduce complications.

---

## 🧑‍⚕️ Dr. Khaleelullah’s Advice

> “First aid doesn’t replace medical care — it prevents further harm until expert help arrives.”

Every household and school should keep a **basic first aid kit and a splint**, and everyone should know how to use them.  
In trauma, the first 15 minutes can **save mobility and even life**.
