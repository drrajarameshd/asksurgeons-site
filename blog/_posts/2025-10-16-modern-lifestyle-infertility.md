## Understanding Fertility and Egg Reserve

A woman is born with **all the eggs she will ever have** â€” roughly 1 to 2 million at birth.  
By puberty, this number drops to about 3â€“4 lakhs, and with each menstrual cycle, one dominant egg matures and is released.  
Over time, this **egg reserve naturally declines**, and after the age of 35, both the **quantity and quality** of eggs decrease significantly.

Tests such as **AMH (Anti-MÃ¼llerian Hormone)** and **Antral Follicle Count (AFC)** help assess ovarian reserve.  
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding smoking, alcohol, or extreme stress can help preserve fertility longer.

## Common Causes of Infertility in Women

1. **Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD)** â€“ One of the most common causes. It leads to irregular ovulation, hormonal imbalance, and insulin resistance.  
2. **Thyroid Disorders** â€“ Both hypo- and hyperthyroidism affect menstrual cycles and ovulation.  
3. **Overweight or Underweight** â€“ Excess fat alters estrogen levels, while being underweight can suppress ovulation.  
4. **Stress and Sleep Deprivation** â€“ Affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to hormonal disturbances.  
5. **Endometriosis or Tubal Block** â€“ Structural causes that interfere with fertilization or implantation.

## Infertility in Men â€” Often Overlooked

Infertility isnâ€™t only a womanâ€™s problem. Nearly **40â€“50% of infertility cases involve male factors.**

Common issues include:
- **Oligospermia:** Low sperm count  
- **Azoospermia:** Absence of sperm in semen  
- **Abnormal sperm motility or morphology**

### Lifestyle and Environmental Causes:
- Chronic **stress and lack of sleep**
- **Smoking, alcohol**, or drug abuse
- **Obesity and poor diet**
- Exposure to **heat or chemicals** (laptops, tight clothing, workplace hazards)
- **Sedentary lifestyle**

All of these reduce sperm count, motility, and DNA quality â€” impacting fertility potential.

## The Modern Lifestyle Challenge

- **Late Marriages:** Couples delaying parenthood for career goals face reduced fertility due to age.  
- **Stress and Screen Time:** Continuous work pressure and poor mental health interfere with reproductive hormones.  
- **Irregular Diets:** Skipping meals, excessive caffeine, and processed foods contribute to hormonal imbalance.  
- **Addictions:** Smoking, alcohol, and other habits directly damage egg and sperm quality.  

Fertility reflects **overall health**, and modern life often strains this delicate balance.

You should seek expert evaluation if:
- Youâ€™ve been trying for **>1 year (or >6 months if over 35)** without success.  
- Menstrual cycles are irregular or absent.  
- History of thyroid, PCOD, endometriosis, or pelvic infections.

## Available Treatment Options

### ðŸ©º Basic Treatments
- **Lifestyle modifications** â€“ weight control, exercise, stress management  
- **Ovulation induction** â€“ medicines to help release eggs  
- **Treatment of thyroid or hormonal imbalance**

### ðŸ§ª Assisted Reproductive Techniques
1. **IUI (Intrauterine Insemination):** Processed semen is placed directly in the uterus around ovulation.  
2. **IVF (In Vitro Fertilization):** Eggs and sperm are fertilized in a lab; embryos are transferred to the uterus.  
3. **ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection):** A single sperm is injected into an egg â€” useful for severe male infertility.  
4. **Egg or Sperm Freezing:** Allows fertility preservation for those delaying parenthood.  

Modern reproductive medicine provides hope to couples â€” success depends on age, health, and underlying causes.

## Final Thoughts

Adopting a healthy lifestyle, reducing stress, and seeking timely consultation can make a big difference.
