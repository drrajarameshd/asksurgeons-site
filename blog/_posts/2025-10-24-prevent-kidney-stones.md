## 🩺 10 General Tips to Prevent Kidney Stones

1. **Stay well hydrated** — Aim for at least **2.5–3 litres of urine output daily**.  
2. **Limit salt (sodium)** — Excess salt increases calcium in urine, raising stone risk.  
3. **Moderate animal protein** — High meat intake raises uric acid and lowers citrate.  
4. **Eat more citrus fruits** — Lemon, orange, and amla juice increase urinary citrate, a natural stone inhibitor.  
5. **Avoid dehydration during exercise or heat exposure.**  
6. **Maintain a healthy weight** — Obesity and insulin resistance increase stone risk.  
7. **Balance calcium intake** — Don’t cut out dairy completely; low calcium diets may worsen stones.  
8. **Limit sugary and aerated drinks** — Especially colas with phosphoric acid.  
9. **Check your urine pH and stone type** after each episode — treatment varies.  
10. **Follow up every 6–12 months** with ultrasound and urine analysis.

## 🧊 Tips for Calcium Oxalate Stone–Prone Patients

Calcium oxalate stones are the **most common type** (70–80%).  
They form when calcium and oxalate levels rise together in concentrated urine.

✅ **Do’s**
- Drink **lemon water** regularly (rich in citrate).  
- Include **normal dietary calcium** from milk, curd, or paneer.  
- Eat **more fruits and vegetables** — they reduce urinary acidity.  
- Drink water before bed and early morning.

🚫 **Avoid**
- **Spinach, beetroot, nuts, chocolate, tea, and soy products** in excess — all high in oxalate.  
- **Vitamin C supplements >1000 mg/day** (convert to oxalate).  
- **High-salt and high-protein diets.**

## 💎 Tips for Uric Acid Stone–Prone Patients

Uric acid stones occur when urine becomes too acidic (pH < 5.5).

✅ **Do’s**
- **Increase water intake** to dilute urine.  
- Add **lemon or baking soda water** (alkalinizes urine — only under doctor guidance).  
- Prefer **vegetarian proteins** (dal, beans) over red meat or fish.  
- Maintain **ideal body weight**; obesity increases uric acid.  

🚫 **Avoid**
- Red meat, organ meats (liver, kidney), and shellfish.  
- Alcohol, especially beer.  
- Crash dieting or fasting (increases uric acid levels).

## 🧬 Tips for Struvite & Other Stone Types

Struvite stones are usually caused by **chronic urinary infections** — often in women.

✅ **Do’s**
- **Treat and prevent UTIs promptly.**  
- Drink plenty of fluids to flush bacteria.  
- Maintain **good hygiene and regular bladder emptying**.  
- **Follow up** after infection treatment with ultrasound to rule out residual fragments.

🚫 **Avoid**
- Ignoring recurrent urinary infections.  
- Long gaps without medical review after stone treatment.

## 🌿 Final Word

Kidney stones can **almost always be prevented** with hydration, dietary discipline, and regular medical follow-up.
