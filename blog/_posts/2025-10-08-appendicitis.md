![Appendicitis — Inflammation of Appendix](/assets/images/post-images/2025-10-08-appendicitis.webp)

It was a typical Monday morning when **Ayesha**, a 22-year-old college student, walked into the emergency room. She looked pale, her hand pressed firmly against the right side of her abdomen.  
“Doctor,” she whispered, “the pain started near my belly button and now it’s shifted down to the right. I can’t even stand straight.”

As I gently examined her, I noticed classic signs — tenderness in the right lower abdomen, mild fever, and loss of appetite. Her blood report showed raised white blood cell count — a sign of infection. An ultrasound confirmed what I had suspected: **acute appendicitis**.

### **What Is Appendicitis?**

Appendicitis is the inflammation of the **appendix**, a small, finger-like pouch attached to the large intestine. It can occur at any age but is more common in young adults.  
When the opening of the appendix gets blocked — often by stool, infection, or swelling — bacteria multiply rapidly, leading to inflammation and pus formation.

### **Common Signs and Symptoms**

- **Pain starting near the navel** and moving to the lower right abdomen (McBurney’s point).  
- **Loss of appetite** and **nausea**.  
- **Low-grade fever** that may worsen as the infection progresses.  
- **Tenderness and guarding** over the right lower quadrant.  
- Sometimes, **vomiting**, **constipation**, or **diarrhea**.

Not every patient presents the same way — in women, urinary or gynecological causes must be ruled out. That’s why a careful evaluation and imaging are vital.

### **Complications of Untreated Appendicitis**

If not treated promptly, the appendix can **burst (rupture)**, spreading infection inside the abdomen — a condition called **peritonitis**. This can lead to:

- **Abscess formation** (collection of pus).  
- **Sepsis** (infection spreading through the bloodstream).  
- **Bowel obstruction** due to adhesions.

These complications can be life-threatening and need immediate surgical and antibiotic management.

### **Treatment and Recovery**

The standard treatment is **appendectomy** — surgical removal of the appendix. It can be performed by:

- **Laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery** — minimal scars, faster recovery.  
- **Open surgery** — used when the appendix has ruptured or abscess has formed.

Ayesha underwent a **laparoscopic appendectomy** the same day. The surgery went smoothly. By the next morning, she was sitting up, smiling, and asking when she could go back to college.  
We discharged her in two days, with simple post-operative care advice — light diet, walking daily, and avoiding heavy lifting for two weeks.

### **Takeaway from Dr. Nilofer**

> “Appendicitis doesn’t wait. If abdominal pain shifts to the right side and worsens with movement, don’t ignore it. Early diagnosis and timely surgery can prevent dangerous complications and ensure a quick recovery.”
